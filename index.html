            <strong>Prologue</strong><br>
            It all started when I came across a Twitter post from a co-working space account. They were talking about how different people in their space were working on amazing things, someone building an AI startup, another fine-tuning LLMs, etc., etc.
            I could relate because I often visit cafes (mostly Third Wave) to get some work done. I’d notice someone working on a cool app, or see a guy reading a book I’d just finished. In those moments, I’d think, <em>“We could really vibe and maybe even build something awesome together. If only we connected.”</em>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            At co-working spaces, cafes, and conventions, we often pass by people who could be our best friends, co-founders, mentors, or even investors—if we knew what they were up to, and they knew what we were doing.
            Sure, platforms like LinkedIn exist, but they’re not built for those serendipitous moments. I don’t know this person, what they’re working on, or their interests unless I intentionally look them up. The obvious option is to approach directly, but that’s not always ideal. Maybe they’re deeply focused, not in a mood to chat, or already talking to someone else.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            So, I decided to build <strong>Zonr</strong>, a proximity-based networking app where you can share what you’re working on and discover others around you. If someone’s vibe matches yours, you can instantly connect, effortlessly and without intruding.

            <strong>The App</strong><br>
            I am a solo developer and learning app development on the fly. The app itself, as of now, is still in development. I plan to roll out pilot tests mid to late January 2025.
            <br>Keep and eye on <a href="https://x.com/ZonrAppIN">@ZonrAppIN</a> for updates.
